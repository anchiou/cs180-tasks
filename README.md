### Git Commit Guidelines
To make more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history, here are some guidelines for formatting git commit messages.

Each commit message consists of a **type** and a **subject**:   
`<type>: <subject>`

The **type** must be one of the following:  
**feat**: A new feature  
**fix**: A bug fix  
**docs**: Documentation only changes  
**style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)  
**test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests  

The **subject** contains a short description of the change:    
- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end  
** *Adopted from angular.js guidelines*

Please remember to pull changes regularly and practice rebasing rather than merging. If you don't know how to rebase:

**Always follow the Golden Rule when rebasing:**

## Backend
Java development Kit (JDK)
To develop in Java, you will need to install a JDK. We will use JDK8.

### Intellij IDEA
We will use IntelliJ IDEA for the backend. It is a Java integrated development environment for developing software.

   1.  Download and install IntelliJ on your personal computer.
       There are two versions: Ultimate and Community. If possible, please get the Ultimate version. It is FREE for students.  
       First, apply as a student at the link below.
